# ML Kit Showcase Apps with Material Design

These apps demonstrate how to build an end-to-end user experience with [Google ML Kit APIs](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/guides) and following the new [Material for ML design guidelines](https://material.io/collections/machine-learning/).

The goal of this app is to showcase an ideal ML Kit driven end to end solution for various ML Kit vision APIs and use cases. The following use cases are covered:
* Visual search using the Object Detection & Tracking API - An end to end workflow for object detection and product search
* “Wild Bird” search using the Object Detection & Tracking API - An end to end workflow for object detection and search using a custom TensorFlow Lite model
