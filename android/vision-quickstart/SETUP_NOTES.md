```

## Gradle Configuration
- Updated to version 8.10
- Note: Some deprecated features will be incompatible with Gradle 9.0
- Build cache currently disabled (can be enabled for better performance)

## Android Gradle Plugin (AGP)
- Updated from version 7.3.1 to 8.2.0
- Configured for compileSdk 34
- Added required namespace in app/build.gradle

## Java/Kotlin Configuration
- Java compilation target set to Java 17
- Kotlin compilation target set to Java 17
- Added Java toolchain configuration
- Enabled modern Java toolchain settings

## Android Configuration
- Updated compileSdk to 34
- Added required namespace
- Updated build tools version
- Configured for modern Android development

## ProGuard Configuration
- Created `proguard-rules.pro` with rules for:
  - ML Kit libraries
  - AndroidX components
  - Kotlin-specific rules
  - CameraX components
  - ViewModel components
  - Coroutines and serialization
- Created `proguard.cfg` with app-specific rules for:
  - Demo package classes
  - Activities, fragments, and adapters
  - Camera preview and graphic overlay
  - Vision processors
  - Lifecycle methods and event handlers
- Release build successful with no critical ProGuard errors
- Some template rules didn't match code (normal)

## Build Status
- Debug build: ✅ Successfully building
- Release build: ✅ Successfully building with ProGuard
- Build time: ~16 seconds
- APK location: `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

## ML Kit Features Available
- Face Detection
- Barcode Scanning
- Text Recognition
- Object Detection
- Image Labeling
- Pose Detection
- Face Mesh Detection
- Subject Segmentation
- Multiple language support for text recognition

## Known Issues and Future Tasks
1. Gradle Deprecation Warnings:
   - Some features will be incompatible with Gradle 9.0
   - Need to update to newer APIs in future
2. Kotlin Warnings:
   - Some signature validation warnings in core-ktx
   - No impact on functionality
3. Build Cache:
   - Currently disabled
   - Could improve build times if enabled

## Build Commands
```bash
# Clean and build
./gradlew clean build

# Build with all warnings visible
./gradlew build --warning-mode all

# Build release version
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

## Project Location
- Path: `/Users/thomasschell/Documents/pokedex/mlkit/android/vision-quickstart`
- Based on ML Kit Vision Quickstart template
- Customized for modern Android development practices

## Device Testing
- Tested on Pixel 8a (Android 14, SDK 34)
- USB debugging enabled
- Device properly recognized by ADB
- Camera permissions granted
